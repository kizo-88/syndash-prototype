# Syndash Prototype

This repository contains a prototype for the **Odor Monitoring Dashboard**, which visualizes odor concentration data based on the **FIDOL** method (Frequency, Intensity, Duration, Offensiveness, Location). The prototype is built with basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to track and analyze odor data.

## Features

- Displays a basic interface to show odor data.
- Includes interactive charts and data visualization components.
- Uses the FIDOL method for tracking and analyzing odor characteristics.
- Basic form inputs for capturing odor data.
- Responsive layout for displaying on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - For the page structure.
- **CSS** - For styling and layout of the page.
- **JavaScript** - For handling interactive features and data manipulation.
- **Chart.js** - For data visualization (if included in the actual project).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kizo-88/syndash-prototype.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd syndash-prototype
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the prototype.

   Alternatively, if you have a local server setup, you can host the project there.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

```
syndash-prototype/
│
├── index.html           # Main HTML file for the dashboard.
├── styles.css           # Styling and layout for the dashboard.
├── script.js            # JavaScript for interactive elements.
└── assets/              # Any static assets (images, icons, etc.)
```

### index.html

Contains the main structure of the dashboard, including the form for data input and sections for displaying the odor data.

### styles.css

This file includes styles for layout, typography, colors, and responsiveness of the dashboard.

### script.js

Handles the logic for:
- User interaction with input fields.
- Data manipulation and processing.
- Updating the chart with odor data.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to interact with the odor dashboard.
2. Enter odor data (Frequency, Intensity, Duration, Offensiveness, and Location).
3. The data will be processed and displayed visually in a chart.
4. Use the form to capture new odor data, which will update the dashboard in real-time.
